***Github SIBOOR V0.1 kit assembly manual instruction.***

* Page 10-11: In SIBOOR V0.1 kit, profile A and profile B are combined into one profile, both of which have been tapped and are common to each other. C profile and H profile are combined into one profile, both of which are drilled and tapped, which are common to each other.

* Page 14: The SIBOOR V0.1 kit uses the guide strip of purple PCB, so it does not need to use the printed parts and embedded M2 nut.

* Pages 15, 17 and 71: As described above, two purple PCBs are used as guide rail fixing strips to fix the MGN7 guide rail.

* Page 99: The SIBOOR V0.1 kit is already equipped with a soldered limit switch, plug and play.

* Page 108: The hot end of the SIBOOR V0.1 Young Version requires a longer catheter (29.5mm). Make sure that the bearing is flush with the shaft, otherwise it will cause friction between the metal shaft and the motor. Place the side of the bearing flat on the table and press the white gear with both thumbs to make the bearing flush with the shaft.

* Page 111: Before installing the hot end to the printed parts, be sure to install the heating rod and thermal sensor in advance.

* Page 119: 2.5 × 6 self tapping screws are recommended here. Too long self tapping screw is easy to damage the printed parts.

* Page 126: In addition to using double-sided adhesive tape to fix the power supply, you can also choose to install two M3 × 6 screws on the reverse side  to fix the power supply.

* Page 127: In SIBOOR V0.1 kit, the step-down module is cancelled.

* Page 128: SIBOOR V0.1 kit, using a two in one Gemini motherboard, using four nylon posts and M3 × 8 Screws are fixed on the acrylic panel.

* Page 132-139: See the SIBOOR V0.1 kit supplementary instructions separatel
